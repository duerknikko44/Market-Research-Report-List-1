<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acrylic Resin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermosetting Acrylic Resin</li><li>Thermoplastic Acrylic Resin</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The acrylic resin market is primarily divided into two main types: thermosetting acrylic resin and thermoplastic acrylic resin. Thermosetting acrylic resins undergo a curing process that solidifies their structure, making them ideal for applications requiring durability and heat resistance, such as coatings and adhesives. In contrast, thermoplastic acrylic resins remain flexible upon heating, allowing them to be reshaped or molded multiple times, making them suitable for products like automotive components and transparent displays. Both types serve diverse industrial needs.</p></p>
