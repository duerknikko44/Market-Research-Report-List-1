<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Emissions Analysers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>In-situ</li><li>Extractive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The emissions analyzers market is generally categorized into two types: in-situ and extractive systems. In-situ analyzers measure gas concentrations directly at the source with minimal sample handling, providing real-time data and quick responses to changes in emissions. In contrast, extractive analyzers involve drawing a gas sample from the emission source to a separate analysis system, allowing for more precise measurements but introducing potential delays and sample contamination risks. Both types serve vital roles in environmental monitoring and regulatory compliance.</p></p>
